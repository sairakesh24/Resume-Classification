In today's fast-paced recruitment landscape, companies receive thousands of resumes for open positions. Manually sorting through these resumes is time-consuming, inefficient, and prone to human bias. This project presents a Resume Classification System that leverages Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically categorize resumes based on relevant job roles, skill sets, and experience levels.
The system is designed to assist HR professionals, recruiters, and hiring managers in filtering resumes more efficiently, enabling faster decision-making and reducing time-to-hire.
Project Workflow:-
1.Data Collection
Gathered resumes across various industries and roles.
Converted resumes into plain text for processing.
2.Data Preprocessing
Text cleaning, tokenization, and stop-word removal.
Skill and keyword extraction using NLP.
3.Feature Engineering
Generated feature vectors using TF-IDF or word embeddings.
4.Model Training
Trained classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest).
Fine-tuned hyperparameters for optimal accuracy.
5.Evaluation
Evaluated performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
